# Line Coding of Real Time Signals (using LCDK 6748 DSP Board)

#We are the first year M.Tech students of Communication and Signal Processing from IIT JAMMU. We have designed and presented our Hardware Software Based Project for Digital Communication course using DSP Development Kit & Code Composer Studio.
Here we have used Polar RZ (Return to Zero) line coding.
By just varing the sqaure1 square2 lookup table we can generate various line coding like Bipolar NRZ, Bipolar RZ, Biphase Manchester, Differential Manchester, etc.
Setup: LCDK 6748 DSP Board, JTAG, Power supply, Oscilloscope.
