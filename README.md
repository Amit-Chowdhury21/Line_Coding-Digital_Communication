# Line Coding of Real Time Signals (using LCDK 6748 DSP Board)


#We are the first year M.Tech students of Communication and Signal Processing from IIT JAMMU. We have designed and presented our Hardware Based Project for Digital Communication course.
Here we have used Polar RZ (Return to Zero) line coding.
By just varing the sqaure1 square2 lookup table we can generate various line coding.
Setup:
1. Power the DSP Board using 5V Voltage Adapter, according to the required Power Rating.
2. Connect JTAG in DSP Board directly and to the CPU or Laptop using USB cable.
3. For taking Real Time input, connect microphone or Aux cale from mobile or any device to DSP Board's Audio Input port.
4. Audio Output Port can be connected to Digital Oscilloscope. OR
